# Open5gs deployment for OpenShift

## Purpose

This project contains the helm chart to deploy open5gs (https://open5gs.org/) on OpenShift taking care of using Red Hat base images or certified containers and reducing the privileged requirements.
Red Hat UBI (Universal Based Image) are used to build the open5gs containers.


## Project deployment

To deploy this project in your existing namespace <5GCORENS>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clustership/ocpopen5gs.git
cd ocpopen5gs/helm-chart

export NS=<5GCORENS>
```


Then create a values-overrides.yaml file to customize your helm deployment and install the chart in you namespace.

```bash
cd helm-chart
cat <<EOF > values-overrides.yaml
mongodb:
  adminPassword: bikinibottom # (change this)
  password: patrickstar # (change this too)

open5gs:
  logger:
    level: info # use debug to troubleshoot

#
# Change nodePort to a free available
#
amf:
  nodePort: 31412 
EOF

helm install -f values-overrides.yaml open5gs .
watch oc get pods

```


After installation, check that upf pods is running. Check that Replicasets current state match the desired state.
If not, check replicaset status by using:

```bash
oc describe rs <rs-name>
```

## TODOS

* Write a device plugin to manage tun device allocation
* Use initContainer and readiness probes to control start order of each containers (mongo and upf before smf before other CNFs).
* Write a open5gs scc to reduce unused privleges
* Change helm chart to support conditional d√©ployment of CNFs (using PCF or UPF from other namespaces and/or vendors)
* Use multus to create all segregated networks used in 5G Core
